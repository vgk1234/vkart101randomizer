    <h1>Vinita's Randomizer Sketch</h1>
    <p>This is my randomizer sketch. In this project, I used javascript to create a randomizer 
    which generates pictures of ice cream. Since ice cream is one of my favorite foods, I decided to place
    a combination of some of my favorite ice cream flavors in the canvas.</p> 
    <p>Click on the canvas or button to generate an image.</p>
